## Overview

Municipal corporations face various challenges in managing and coordinating administrative processes, such as issuing permits, handling public grievances, and managing civic services. The lack of a centralized system leads to fragmented data, delayed processes, and reduced transparency. These issues result in inefficiencies, limited accountability, and poor user experiences for both citizens and municipal employees.

## Problem Statement

### Key Issues:
- **Lack of Centralized Information:** Public service documents and information are not stored in one place, causing delays and confusion.
- **Inefficient Workflow:** Poor communication between departments results in slow processing times.
- **Limited Transparency:** Citizens can't easily track their applications or complaints, reducing transparency.
- **Limited Accountability:** Without centralized oversight, tracking the status of applications and resolving grievances becomes challenging, reducing transparency and accountability.
- **Poor User Experience:** Citizens and municipal employees struggle with navigating multiple systems and dealing with unclear processes, leading to dissatisfaction and decreased trust in the municipal administration.

## Proposed Solution

### Features:
1. **Centralized Document Access:**
   - Users can easily access their documents by authenticating into a centralized database.
   - Cross-department access allows employees to search for documents such as birth certificates, building permits, and trade licenses.
   - Advanced filters (document type, applicant name, date range, department) help refine searches.
   - Access controls require sign-in before accessing documents, with notifications sent to respective department officers.

2. **Document Viewing and Sharing:**
   - Employees can view documents but need to request permission to download them.
   - Departments can approve or deny sharing requests to ensure data security.

3. **Admin Portal for Death and Birth Certificates:**
   - Dashboard displaying new and pending applications.
   - Deep learning model assesses document originality.
   - Advanced OCR technologies automatically extract and verify information.
   - Access to hospital data for verification.

4. **Automated Building Permit Compliance Check:**
   - Automated system checks building applications against government regulations.
   - Generates detailed compliance reports.
   - User-friendly interface for officers to review applications and take actions.

### Benefits:
- **Efficiency:** Streamlined processes reduce manual effort and speed up application handling.
- **Accuracy:** Deep learning and OCR technologies minimize errors and ensure data integrity.
- **Transparency:** Real-time application status updates improve transparency for citizens.
- **Accountability:** Centralized system enhances oversight and accountability.
- **User Satisfaction:** Simplified processes increase trust and satisfaction among citizens and employees.
- **Resource Optimization:** Frees up municipal staff to focus on other critical tasks.

### Future Enhancements:
- **Hospital Collaboration:** Easier access to data through hospital partnerships.
- **Role-Based Authentication:** Structured work for employees based on roles.
